## üíª Preparation

### Installation

```
conda create -n vdr python=3.9
conda activate vdr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Download

Prepare data using identifiers in the YAML configuration files at `conf/data_stores/*.yaml`.

```bash
# Download a single dataset file
python download.py nq_train
# Download multiple dataset files:
python download.py nq_train trivia_train
# Download all dataset files:
python download.py all
```

<!--
## üëæ Training

```bash
EXPERIMENT_NAME=test
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=4 train_vdr.py \
hydra.run.dir=./experiments/$EXPERIMENT_NAME/train \
train=vdr_nq \
data_stores=train_datasets \
train_datasets=[nq_train]
```
- `hydra.run.dir`:  directory where training outputs will be saved.
- `train`: training configuration file in `conf/train/*.yaml`
- `data_stores`: data configuration file in `conf/data_stores/*.yaml` 
- `train_datasets`: identifiers of train dataset

During training, we present an `Info Card` to monitor the progress of the training. To better under the `Info Card`, please refer to [here](https://github.com/jzhoubu/VDR/tree/master/docs/info_card).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Text-to-text Retrieval
```python
>>> import torch
>>> from src.vdr import Retriever

# Initialize the retriever
>>> vdr_text2text = Retriever.from_pretrained("vsearch/vdr-nq")

# Set up the device
>>> device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
>>> vdr_text2text = vdr_text2text.to(device)

# Define a query and a list of passages
>>> query = "What are the benefits of drinking green tea?"
>>> passages = [
...     "Green tea is known for its antioxidant properties, which can help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. It also contains catechins, which have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. Drinking green tea regularly may help improve overall health and well-being.",
...     "The history of coffee dates back to ancient times, with its origins in Ethiopia. Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world and is enjoyed by millions of people every day.",
...     "Yoga is a mind-body practice that combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation. It has been practiced for thousands of years and is known for its many health benefits, including stress reduction and improved flexibility.",
...     "Eating a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins is essential for maintaining good health. It provides the body with the nutrients it needs to function properly and can help prevent chronic diseases."
... ]

# Embed the query and passages
>>> q_emb = vdr_text2text.encoder_q.embed(query)  # Shape: [1, V]
>>> p_emb = vdr_text2text.encoder_p.embed(passages)  # Shape: [4, V]

 # Query-passage Relevance
>>> scores = q_emb @ p_emb.t()
>>> print(scores)
tensor([[91.1257, 17.6930, 13.0358, 12.4576]], device='cuda:0')
```

### Cross-modal Retrieval
```python
>>> vdr_cross_modal = Retriever.from_pretrained("vsearch/vdr-cross-modal") # Note: encoder_p for images, encoder_q for text.

>>> image_file = '/export/data/jzhoubu/workspace/vsearch/examples/images/mars.png'
>>> texts = [
...     "Four thousand Martian days after setting its wheels in Gale Crater on Aug. 5, 2012, NASA‚Äôs Curiosity rover remains busy conducting exciting science. The rover recently drilled its 39th sample then dropped the pulverized rock into its belly for detailed analysis.",
...     "ChatGPT is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. Based on a large language model, it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language."
... ]
>>> image_emb = vdr_cross_modal.encoder_p.embed(image_file) # Shape: [1, V]
>>> text_emb = vdr_cross_modal.encoder_q.embed(texts)  # Shape: [2, V]

# Image-text Relevance
>>> scores = image_emb @ text_emb.t()
>>> print(scores)
tensor([[0.3209, 0.0984]])
```


### Disentanglement and Reasoning
```python
# Disentangling query embedding
>>> disentanglement = vdr_text2text.encoder_q.dst(query, k=768, visual=True) # Generate a word cloud if `visual`=True
>>> print(disentanglement)
{
    'tea': 6.9349799156188965,
    'green': 5.861555576324463,
    'bitter': 4.233378887176514,
    ...
}

# Retrieval reasoning on query-passage match
>>> reasons = vdr_text2text.explain(q=query, p=passages[0], k=768, visual=True)
>>> print(reasons)
{
    'tea': 41.2425175410242,
    'green': 38.784010452150596,
    'effects': 1.1575102038585783,
    ...
}
```


<!--
### Example: Semi-parametric Search
```python
# Alpha search (non-parametric query -> parametric passage)
>>> q_bin = vdr.encoder_q.embed(query, bow=True)
>>> p_emb = vdr.encoder_p.embed(passages)
>>> scores = q_bin @ p_emb.t()

# Beta search (parametric query -> non-parametric passage)
>>> q_emb = vdr.encoder_q.embed(query)
>>> p_bin = vdr.encoder_p.embed(passages, bow=True)
>>> scores = q_emb @ p_bin.t()
```
